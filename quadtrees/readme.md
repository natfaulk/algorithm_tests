# KNN Using Quadtrees

Using this paper [Ranking in Spatial Databases](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=718930) can find the K-Nearest-Neghbours to a point much faster than brute forcing. Can find 200 nearest points in a population of 100,000 in <5ms on my PC. The interactive demo defaults to 1000 points, finding the nearest 10 (ie k = 10)
