# Algorithm tests for other projects

Interactive demos of algorithms I have quickly written in JS before implementing in other projects.
Mostly so I could verify the algorithms worked as I expected. Not necessarily implemented in the most efficient or optimal way, but in a way that was suitable for the situation in which I needed them.  

All written using ES6 so a fairly modern browser is required.
